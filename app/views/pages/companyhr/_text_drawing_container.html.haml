			Technical Recruiting 101 is designed for
			<strong>in-house HR/recruiting professionals</strong>
			who want to make an impact on the company's business by
			meeting its critical
			<strong>technical talent acquisition</strong> needs,
			yet feeling bogged down by the jargon
			and cryptic language in job descriptions and
			resumes, commonly used by technical people.
			
	%section{id:"program_description"}
		%p
			This course will lay a solid foundation for understanding
			the inner working of 
			typical <strong>software engineering teams</strong>,
			tools of the trade,
			how technical people work individually
			and as a group.  You&rsquo;ll learn how to
			<strong>decode technical terms</strong>,
			<strong>ask revealing questions</strong> to
			hiring managers and candidates, find
			<strong>resources and best practices</strong>
			for technical recruiting. You can apply to this
			knowledge immediately and
			make your recruiting easier and more productive.
		%p
			Each week, we&rsquo;ll meet for a 3-hour session, which
			includes two parts: <strong>presentation</strong> and
			<strong>interactive workshop</strong>
			(using real job descriptions and resumes
			at your company).  We keep this
			class small so everyone’s questions and needs can be addressed.
